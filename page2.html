                        encourage me in faith and inspire me to grow spiritually. 
                        Their support and love reflect the grace and kindness of God in my life.

                        through music and praise. As I always say 'for an audience of One'.

                    <p>
                        I also started going on nature trips, particularly towards the end of the pandemic.
                        The security in our province wasn’t very strict at that time, 
                        which allowed us to travel freely.

                    <p>At a young age I was really into singing and music. The skill and talent
                        that I have I used it for church ministry.

                    <p>Whenever I see landscapes there is something in me that wants to capture it.
                        I was also part of photography club back in high-school which somehow 
                        developed my knowledge and skills in photography and editing.

                        already exposed to sports.
